# History

## Early Years

Rowan is of royal blood, but the middle child of 5 to the current king.  For this reason he sees little reason to bother with the lessons of court and gavel.  Instead he skipped out to the forest whenever he had the opportunity, preferring the company of the forest and cliff over the comfort and extravagance of the court.

He took to a bow quickly in his early years, proving to be an aspiring archer even to those older than he is.  For this reason he was often bullied and ignored even when trying to help those older than he.

Due to this upbringing he re-focused on escaping outside the castle.  He would be gone for weeks at a time, only returning to let his parents know he was still around.  His parents would always try to push him to follow the family lineage, but secretly they knew it was not the life for him.

## Wanderlust

Eventually his parents gifted him with a family heirloom and some starting money, giving him the freedom to spread his wings and see to his own path.  It was a hard farewell for both sides, but after they both knew it was for the best.

Rowan spent many years on the road, wandering about almost aimlessly from place to place, job to job, never staying or settling, never returning home.  He did his best to send messages to his parents once and a while telling brief stories of what he was doing.  Most were half-truths, saying he was doing fine when he had to rely on his survival skills to scrape by but soon those became less and less frequent.

One day, long after he spent his last coin he came to a small town.  His pack light from the meager rations he was surviving on forced him to a bit of civilization.  It was easier than scraping by on the local flora and meat was always a welcome delicacy when he was out of arrows.

## Kandel Smit

He soon found himself near the location where Kandel Smit will be built.  It started more of an over grown dock, but it did have a bar so almost by decree it was considered a town.  Rowan was seen as too spry and weak compared to the local population, even humans pushing him away from getting a job on the docks, even though Rowan was up for the task.  The quiet nature instilled in him by his upbringing causing him to seek the shadows than prove his worth to a few drunken dockhands.

All the same for Rowan.  His past and upbringing teaching him the shadows were his friends over the company of strangers.  He turned back to the swamp, making his land wherever his feet would take him.  His home wherever his pack would rest.

In these early years he started game hunting the local swamp life.  Crocs when no arrow-wood was to be found, hare and pheasant when arrows were in supply.  His daily catch sold to the humans, orcs and anyone else in the town.  The lutren population preferring their mostly fish diet.  This was the way Rowan spent most his days.  Catching enough game to keep his gear in check, the mangroves and swamp pines serving as his bed at night.  Makes the coin spread out longer after all.

## Eyes of Green

One day, of his many trips back into town he saw a fellow elven woman fighting with what looked to be a half-orc.  A very strange sight to see in this swampy town full of half-breeds, humans, luten and vulpani.  This type of scene was common in such a backwater area.  Sure the town my shun someone who has an altercation with their spouse, but the transgression is forgotten as soon as the next bit of gossip spreads.

This one was different.  Rowan looked over to the woman, his gaze slowly uncovered by the brow of his hat, looking over at the public commotion.  The woman doing her best to fend off the half-orc, adding some spots of darker green on his arms as some blows found their mark.

The more Rowan watched, the more unease he felt about the situation.  Something told him this was not right.  As if the scales of life were unbalanced.

He didn't know why at the time, but his feet seemed to move him toward the woman, the fresh catch of hare and pheasant over one shoulder, his pack over the other.  It wasn't long until the large half-orc took notice of Rowan, stopping the fight if only momentarily.  Jaundice yellow eyes staring right at Rowan.  The half-orc went on about how unfertile the woman was.  The daft beast thought he could have a child with the elven woman.  Obviously his strength was disproportional to his intelligence.

Preferring to not go toe to toe with the half-orc over feats of strength, Rowan instead appealed to the half-orc's baser instincts and tossed his catch at the half-orc, causing him to drop the woman's wrists as he caught the meat, forcing her the ground.  Rowans request was simple.  The girl in exchange for the meat.  Dumbfounded at the situation, the half-orc looked back and forth between the meat and what assumed to be his wife.  With a heavy snort the public got their answer, the half-orc stomping off, kicking up mud as a rampaging bull.  No one ever saw him again.

It was the first meeting between Rowan and Felicity, but fate seemed to have brought them together.  They spend many a time together after that, Rowan feeling something deep inside rarely felt before.  A sense of belonging, a sense of calm and feeling right.

## A Dock Becomes a City

After many years of living off the land and saving coin he was able to purchase a hole in the wall sized shop where he converted it to a butcher.  There he would collect the game from his hunting and traps, skin and process the meat into whatever he could make.  The work was long, but it kept his archery skills sharp and gave him some coin in his pocket.  the chance to see [[Felicity Willowthorn|Felicity]] from time to time.  He would even be guilty of saving the best cuts of his meats for her.

Rowan felt his wanderlust fading.  He was starting to settle in, even the little town's community was opening up to the strange looking elven lad.  Thoughts of settling down would fade in and out of his mind.  Of what could be, and what price Rowan would have to pay.  He felt the cost getting less and less, Felicity becoming more and more like the woman he meant to be with.

As time went on, even Felicity was able to scrape enough coin together to start a shop of her own, serving a new drink to the land called coffee.  This proved to be very profitable since the drink kept the dock workers alert and gave them more energy to speed up the loading and unloading of goods.

It was around this time Rowan's attention faded from his own business as he spent more time in the coffee shop than his own shop.  It wasn't soon after he proposed, she said yes, and they moved under one roof.  His butcher shop became more tablespace since the coffee shop was the bigger business and business was good!

## Nightshift Brewery Company

Thanks to the ever increasing trade and dock work it was decided the shop will be open all day and all night.  Much easier to manage since the elves didn't require nearly as much sleep.  When moving to be open all the time the store had a new name.  "Nightshift Brewery Company".  The name helped spread the reputation though the town, quickly being known for a place to get some tea, coffee, or something stronger while getting the town's latest gossip.

## A Friend in Need

It was during this time Rowan befriended a dockhand by the name of Jim Thrope.  He and his wife became quick friends to Rowan and Felicity, playing cards and helping each other out to smooth over life's little bumps.

Unfortunately, in the land of Dardenell such joys only last for so long.  Jim had an accident befall him while unloading a ship.  A all too common and tragic accident for sure.  His wife doubled as the town healer, doing her best with what little the town could provide, even making others suffer as she saved the best medicine for Jim.  As with most tales the bottle added in Jim's recovery, but at the cost of his manners, his job, and eventually his wife.

## Recovery

Rowan and Felicity did their best to support Jim and Shadow, but when Shadow left Jim that was the last straw.  One night when carrying Jim back to his apartment Rowan decided it was time for an intervention, even if it meant jeopardizing their friendship.  After getting Jim to bed Rowan tied Jim to the bed with rope, keeping vigilant over him for the rest of the night into the following day.

Rowan would go off into the swamp, using the only skills he knew to help his friend.  The tea his friend drank suppressed the need for alcohol, but was a hard to find and impossible to cultivate herb.  The rarity forced Rowan to only pick a bit at a time, lest the pant die and he loses the source to overharvesting.  For days at a time he would be off, devoted to bringing the good back into his best friend.

Felicity would do her best to keep an eye on Jim, but Rowans absence was felt more and more as time went on.  Felicity would never think of trying to stop Rowan.  Telling him it's ok for him to be gone for so long, even if she was more trying to convince herself she could manage Jim and the coffee shop.

When Rowan was in town he was able to help manage the coffee shop with Felicity and help his friend.  But those early days were the roughest on Jim and more of the tea was needed which meant Rowan would be away more often.  However the work was paying off.  Jim was improving first week to week, then day by day.  Even the docks were considering him for a promotion form dockhand to foreman.  Allowing Jim to setup his own crew and let the youngsters do the heavy lifting.

That was until one fateful night...

## Justice

Rowan grew more and more concerned as the morning dawned.  Jim was usually an early bird, hanging out by the docks waiting for the next ship to come in, but he didn't show.

After the morning shift Rowan decided to start investigating on his own.  It didn't take long for him to reach Jim's apartment, knocking their secret knock, but getting no answer.  He opened the door to Jim's room, finding his friend in a pool of his own blood, the front of his shirt ripped to shreds.  It was obvious Jim was dead.  His flesh cool by the time he was found.  He started investigating, asking around if anyone knew anything.  From their statements he was able to piece together Jim's attackers were after more than his petty coffers.  Instead a beat-up old trunk was missing.

Rowan could feel that age old wanderlust growing in him, calling him to seek out who killed his best friend, bring them to justice, and let Jim rest in peace.

## On the Road Again

Rowan had initially promised Felicity he would be around more often and that seemed to be an easy promise to keep.  However the death of his friend couldn't be ignored.  He would have to travel to track down his murderers, and Rowan had no idea what was in store...
